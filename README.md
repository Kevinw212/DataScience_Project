# First DataScience_Project
# 📊 Data Science Project: Classify the Student's Academic Performance Change
This repository contains the dataset of changes in student academic performance influenced by several mental health factors and student habits. It also contains the python notebook code for data modelling (classify the academic performance changes of the new data).
#Notes:This is my first DataScience project, and I'm looking forward to continue making projects like this later. This repository also help me understand more about github.


# 🔍 Project Scope
* Import and read data from GDrive, using pandas
