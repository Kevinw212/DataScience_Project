# First DataScience_Project
# 📊 Data Science Project: Classify the Student's Academic Performance Change
This repository contains the dataset of changes in student academic performance influenced by several mental health factors and student habits. It also contains the python notebook code for data modelling (classify the academic performance changes of the new data).



# 🔍 Project Scope
* Import and read data from GDrive, using pandas
* Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature selection 
* Data modelling (classifier)
* Model performance evaluation (confusion matrix, accuracy, etc.)
* Hyperparameter tuning

# 🤖 Algorithm
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
  
# 📈 Evaluation Method
* Accuracy (Report)
* Confusion Matrix
* KFold-validation
  
# 🛠️ Tools & Library
* Python
* Pandas
* Plotly express
* Scikit-learn
